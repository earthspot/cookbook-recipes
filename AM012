Change all Scaler's scale
Notice that I used 'scale input' instead of 'scale' here
since when you use the 'all' construct, Belcanto looks for everything that could match in the agents. 
There's an output port on the scaler agent that also contains the 'scale' word (scale note output) 
and setting that to a scale isn't valid. By using 'scale input', only the actual ports for setting the scales 
are selecting by the 'all' construct.
