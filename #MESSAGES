[IC] What is the reason for 'simple' ? (AM -do you know?)
[AM] think, as it has to mandatorily be a Belcanto name could be any other 

AM006, AM007
[IC] This is nice, AM -I wish I'd known about it long before now.
When I try it, the .WAV created is always 'audio.wav' which overwrites any prev version.
[AM] sorry, forgot to mention this overwrite hassle...
Is there a way to change the name? (except by hand, once the file has been created)
[AM] that i'm aware no (i'm not a programmer..;-)

AM008
[IC] +AM Brilliant! I was just going to ask you how to do this!
[AM] keep comming with "Eigen Belcanto wishes/ridles" guess I'm not the only one pleased to solve them
