MH005 line 18
[IC] What is the reason for 'simple' ? (AM -do you know?)
[AM] think, as it has to mandatorily be a Belcanto name could be any other 
[MH] simple cut n paste type from pico mix - fixed

AM006, AM007
[IC] This is nice, AM -I wish I'd known about it long before now.
When I try it, the .WAV created is always 'audio.wav' which overwrites any prev version.
[AM] sorry, forgot to mention this overwrite hassle...
Is there a way to change the name? (except by hand, once the file has been created)
[AM] that i'm aware no (i'm not a programmer..;-)

AM008
[IC] +AM Brilliant! I was just going to ask you how to do this!
[AM] keep comming with "Eigen Belcanto wishes/ridles" guess I'm not the only one pleased to solve them

[AM] Still about AM008 - running scripts either from EiegnCommaner or inside a talker.
There must be a "name" field iside the script file, that name must mandatorily be a Belcanto name,
but the actual file name +.txt can be anything we want... confusions.
Example:
I think there is no way to run the script file (or any factory script) "Pico 1 Tonics" 
Try copy it from (factory scripts reside in pi/release-2.0.74-stable/resources/scripts/lights)
and inside the file add a fiel 
name
    tonic script

Then use AM008 
(overall I cant understand how EigenD know about the script files... and this naming situation is accurate or not.
needs some "love".

[AM] Belcanto interpreter - play Belcanto from Eigenharp Pico
This is an effor to update from 1.4 to 2.0 from here:
http://www.eigenlabs.com/wiki/2.0/Pico_Interpreter/
ATTENTION Cannot seem to put the keys O = oops and B = backspace (from course 2) correct.
If you enter manualy the new layout it works; not from the script...
