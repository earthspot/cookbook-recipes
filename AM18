ALPHA - Breath control on Sampler 2
Doing AM16 will give a fixed volume on the sampler. If you want to make it based on the pressure 
with which you hit the key on the keyboard, connect a new wire from the Volume Output (under Outputs) 
on the AHDSR 1 agent and going into the Volume on the Gain agent. 
This will dynamically change the volume based upon the strength of your key-press.
